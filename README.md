# UnderwaterParticles
Java particle simulator in an underwater environment.

Implements a Swing GUI

Paint particles into your underwater world, create metal structures to contain particles.

This program simulates falling sand, air bubbles and oil. The program also includes a tool that will generate particles that touch it and a destructor that deletes particles touching it, creating vapor as an effect. There is also an option to reverse the gravity back and forth in the simulation.
