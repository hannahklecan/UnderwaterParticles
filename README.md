# UnderwaterParticles
Java particle simulator in an underwater environment.

This program simulates falling sand, air bubbles and oil. The program also includes a tool that will generate particles that touch it and a destructor that deletes particles, creating vapor as an effect. There is also an option to reverse the gravity of the simulation.
